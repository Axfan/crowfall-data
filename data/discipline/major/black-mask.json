    "description": "Maintaining a hidden identity is a key attribute of some of the most stealthy fighters, those who cloak themselves in the darkness waiting to strike. This domain belongs to Malekai, The Lord of Shadows, and inspires The Black Mask into maintaining a covert and sly presence. They lay in wait for the perfect moment to strike, revealing themselves at the most opportune moment or ambushing an adversary with a backstab.",
